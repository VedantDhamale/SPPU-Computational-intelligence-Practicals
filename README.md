# Distributed Systems Mini Projects

This repository contains multiple mini-projects demonstrating various core concepts in distributed systems. Each project folder includes client-server implementations, Jupyter notebooks, and Python scripts exploring different networking and system topics.

## 📁 Project Structure

### 🔹 PR1 - Basic Client-Server Communication

- `Client.py`: Python socket client implementation.
- `Server.py`: Python socket server implementation.

### 🔹 PR2 - Enhanced Client-Server in Python

- `Client.py`: New Python client (updated from previous notebook version).
- `Server.py`: New Python server.

### 🔹 PR3 - Project Placeholder

- Contains additional related implementation files (to be updated).

### 🔹 PR5 - Load Balancing

- `PR_5.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing a load balancing technique.
- Legacy files (like `Load Balancing.ipynb`) have been removed.

### 🔹 PR6 - Resource Sharing / File Distribution

- `PR6.ipynb`: New version of the resource-sharing implementation.

### 🔹 PR7 - Another Advanced Concept

- `PR7.IPYNB`: Notebook exploring another concept (e.g., consensus, scheduling).

### 🔹 PR8 - Additional Work

- Additional resources or future expansion (under development).

## 🛠️ Setup and Running

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. To run a client-server example:

1. Open a terminal and start the server:
   ```bash
   python PR1/Server.py
   ```
